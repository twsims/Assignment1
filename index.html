            <p>A website is a collection of web pages that are designed to provide information to users. Websites are primarily informational and can include text, images, and multimedia content.</p>

            <h2>What is a Web Application?</h2>
            <p>A web application is a software program that runs on a web server and can be accessed through a web browser. Unlike a static website, a web application allows users to interact and perform specific tasks.</p>
